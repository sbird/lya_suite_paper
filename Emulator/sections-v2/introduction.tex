\section{Introduction}\label{sec:intro}

The \lya forest \citep{1965ApJ...142.1633G, 1998ApJ...495...44C, 1998MNRAS.301..478T, 2000ApJ...543....1M, 2001ApJ...552...15H, 2002MNRAS.329..848V, 2006AJ....132..117F, 2006MNRAS.365..231V, 2006ApJS..163...80M} measures the distribution of neutral gas at relatively low densities.
This gas traces the growth of cosmic structure, making the \lya~forest an exceptionally powerful cosmological probe, sensitive to the distribution of dark matter deep in the matter dominated era.
Correlating absorption from different quasar sightlines has allowed detection of the baryon acoustic oscillations and constraints on the expansion of the universe \cite{2011JCAP...09..001S, 2013JCAP...04..026S, 2020ApJ...901..153D, 2022arXiv220913942C}.
The densities probed by the \lya forest from redshift $z=2-5$ are $\sim 1-100 \ \times$ the cosmological mean density.
For these redshifts and densities stellar winds and star formation effects are negligible, though feedback from black holes can be important \citep{2013MNRAS.429.1734V, 2020MNRAS.495.1825C}.
Thus the \lya~forest is also able to measure the primordial fluctuations on some of the smallest scales available, $k \sim 1$ h/Mpc \citep{2004MNRAS.354..684V, 2005ApJ...635..761M, 2006MNRAS.370L..51V, 2005PhRvD..71j3515S, 2006JCAP...10..014S, 2017JCAP...06..047Y, 2020JCAP...04..038P, 2021JCAP...03..049G}.
In addition, the \lya~forest is sensitive to the thermal and ionization history of the intergalactic medium (IGM) \citep{2008MNRAS.386.1131B,2014MNRAS.438.2499B, 2016MNRAS.463.2335N,2019ApJ...872...13W, 2019ApJ...872..101B, 2019MNRAS.490.3177W,2021MNRAS.506.4389G, 2022ApJ...933...59V}, and by constraining the free-streaming length of small structures, the mass scale of thermal relic dark matter \citep{2005PhRvD..71f3534V,  2013PhRvD..88d3502V, 2017PhRvD..96b3522I, 2020JCAP...04..038P, 2021MNRAS.502.2356G, 2021PhRvL.126g1302R, 2022arXiv220914220V}.

The extended Baryon Oscillation Sky Survey (eBOSS), part of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) \cite{2019JCAP...07..017C}, has computed the 1D flux power spectrum along quasar sight lines for over $43,000$ quasars, with a statistical error $\sim 1\%$ at some redshifts.
This exceptional statistical error means that the error budget is dominated by systematic uncertainty, especially uncertainty in the resolution of the spectrograph on small scales \cite{2019JCAP...07..017C}.
The Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) has improved the spectrograph resolution by a factor of two \cite{2022AJ....164..207A}.
Thus, early data from DESI has measured the flux power spectrum at smaller scales ($k \gtrsim 0.035$ km$^{-1}$ s) than SDSS \cite{2023arXiv230606316G, 2023arXiv230606311R}.
Future releases will measure higher redshifts ($z>4.6$) and increase the number of \lya forest quasar spectra by a factor of four over SDSS \cite{2016arXiv161100036D}.

There are other high resolution, small sample datasets of quasar spectra, from which \lya forest flux power measurements have been made \cite{2017MNRAS.466.4332I, 2019MNRAS.489.2536D, 2022MNRAS.509.2842K, 2022MNRAS.515..857E}. Ref.~\cite{2022MNRAS.509.2842K} used spectra from multiple surveys (XQ-100, KODIAQ, and SQUAD) to measure the \lya forest flux power at redshifts $z=2-4.6$ and scales $k\approx0.005-0.1$ km$^{-1}$ s (albeit with larger uncertainty than eBOSS), \textbf{and Ref.~\cite{2022MNRAS.515..857E} presents recent cosmological constraints from these datasets}.
%Combining these higher resolution observations with the larger sample size observations will allow inference based on a broader range of scales than either data set allows separately.

Modeling the \lya forest requires numerical simulations that are able to follow the distribution of gas on small scales.
In this paper we present cosmological parameter inference using a new likelihood built on the PRIYA simulation suite \cite{2023simsuite}.
The PRIYA simulations are in $120$ Mpc/h boxes, and are comprised of $48$ simulations with $2\times 1536^3$ particles (mean inter-particle spacing of $78$ kpc/h), as well as $3$ simulations with $2\times 3072^3$ particles (mean inter-particle spacing of $39$ kpc/h).
The higher of these two resolutions exceeds the resolution of state-of-the-art galaxy formation simulations such as Illustris-TNG \cite{2018MNRAS.475..676S}.
PRIYA is run with the same highly scalable MP-Gadget code as the ASTRID simulation \cite{2022MNRAS.512.3703B,2022MNRAS.513..670N}.
PRIYA contains full hydrodynamic simulations with models of galaxy formation and black hole feedback to $z=2.2$.
PRIYA is thus the first cosmological simulation suite which achieves, in a single box, the required box size of $120$ Mpc/h, capable of minimising sample variance in the \lya forest \cite{2014JCAP...07..005B}, and a resolution high enough that it includes \textbf{the pressure smoothing scale.}\footnote{\textbf{Our model has boosts temperatures during reionization, increasing the smoothing scale \cite{2023simsuite}.}}.
Importantly, this removes the need for the `splicing' correction used in earlier work to combine different boxsizes into a single whole \cite{2014JCAP...07..005B,2020JCAP...04..038P}.

Here, the PRIYA simulations are used to build multi-fidelity emulators \cite{2019JCAP...02..050B, 2022MNRAS.509.2551H, 2022MNRAS.517.3200F} for the flux power spectrum and the mean temperature of the IGM.
Each emulator is a surrogate model, able to reproduce the 1D flux power spectrum or mean IGM temperature for cosmological parameters (within the prior simulation volume) to $\sim 1 \%$ accuracy.
A multi-fidelity emulator combines two different resolution training samples.
Many low fidelity samples are used to explore parameter space, and their output is corrected with a few high fidelity samples.
A multi-fidelity emulator makes predictions for the highest resolution simulation at a fraction of the computational cost of a single fidelity emulator \cite{10.1093/biomet/87.1.1, 2022MNRAS.509.2551H}.
Emulators have been used to study various cosmological probes: the matter power spectrum \citep{Heitmann:2009, Heitmann:2014, Lawrence:2017, Giblin:2019, Euclid:2021, Arico:2021, Giri:2021}, weak lensing shear \citep{Harnois:2019, Davies:2021}, the halo mass function \citep{McClintock:2019, Nishimichi:2019, Bocquet:2022}, the 21-cm signal \citep{Kern:2017, Cohen:2020, Bevins:2021, Bye:2022} and the \lya forest \citep{2019JCAP...02..050B, Rogers:2019, 2021JCAP...05..033P, 2021JCAP...04..059W, Rogers:2021a,2021PhRvL.126g1302R, 2023MNRAS.tmp.2406C}.

Here, we present the first fully resolved multi-fidelity emulator based likelihood framework for the eBOSS \lya forest and the first cosmological constraints derived from it.
Our multi-fidelity emulator is similar to that described in Ref.~\cite{2022MNRAS.517.3200F}, but the simulation volume has been increased by a factor of $64$, and the spatial resolution has been improved by a factor of $1.5$.
We also use mean IGM temperature data \cite{2021MNRAS.506.4389G} to constrain the parameters of helium reionization, data which is ultimately derived from higher resolution quasar surveys \citep{2017MNRAS.466.4332I, 2022MNRAS.509.2842K, 2019MNRAS.489.2536D}.

In summary, our method is: (1) Construct an emulator for the 1D \lya flux power spectrum and mean IGM temperature using the PRIYA simulations \cite{2023simsuite}, Section~\ref{sec:emulator}.
(2) Augment observational errors with estimates of the residual theoretical uncertainty to build a covariance matrix, and correct the flux power spectra for metal contamination as described in Section~\ref{sec:inference}.
(3) Use this emulator and likelihood to constrain cosmological parameters using Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC), with results described in Section~\ref{sec:results}.
We discuss some caveats and compare to earlier work in Section~\ref{sec:discussion} and our conclusions are presented in Section~\ref{sec:conclusions}.
