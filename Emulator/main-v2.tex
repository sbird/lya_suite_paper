\abstract{
We present new cosmological parameter constraints from the eBOSS \lya forest survey. We use a new theoretical model and likelihood based on the PRIYA simulation suite. PRIYA is the first suite to resolve the \lya~forest in a ($120$~Mpc/h~)$^3$ volume, using a multi-fidelity emulation technique. We use PRIYA to predict \lya~forest observables with $\lesssim 1\%$ interpolation error over an $11$ dimensional ($9$ simulated, $2$ in post-processing) parameter space. We identify an internal tension within the flux power spectrum data. 
Once the discrepant data is removed, we find the scalar spectral index at $k = 0.78$h/Mpc to be $n_P = 0.97 - 0.995$ at 68\% confidence from the \lya forest flux power spectrum alone, in good agreement with Planck. The amplitude of matter fluctuations is $\sigma_8 = 0.733 \pm 0.026$ at 68\% confidence, in agreement with Dark Energy Survey weak lensing measurements and in tension with Planck. The effective optical depth to \lya photons from our pipeline is in good agreement with earlier measurements. 
We add measurements of the mean temperature of the intergalactic gas from $z=3.8 - 2.2$ and use them to constrain the duration and heating rate of Helium reionization, finding a preference for an early, hot, Helium reionization event, as suggested by measurements from the Helium \lya~forest. Adding the mean IGM temperature data also increases the significance of the $\sigma_8$ tension. In the near future we will use our pipeline to infer cosmological parameters from the DESI \lya data.

% - Different seed cosmic variance chain added to section 3.3
% - Plot like loo_vs_emu_error_wlegend.pdf but for z=2.2 - 2.6 and use it as main result, rather than the shrunk corner plots.
% - Drop LOO from the 'full posteriors' figure. Add 'with mean temperature'? Or just leave it alone?
%
% Main conclusion:
% There is a discrepancy between the z=2.2-2.4 and z >= 2.6 bins. This drives tensions across the whole parameter space. Clear from the best fit.
